### Dataset

We will use the European Social Survey (ESS) [data portal](https://ess.sikt.no/en/?tab=overview) to extract a timeseries view of European citizens’ views on politics, societal norms, and more, while stratifying by gender in particular. Our goal is to expand on work conducted by The Economist, The Financial Times, and other publications in exploring a recent trend of divergence in political and social opinion between the sexes.

The ESS is a biennial survey of randomly sampled citizens across 31 countries. It is meant to capture the sociopolitical opinions and conditions of private-household residents aged 15 and up in participating countries. The individual respondents are not stable year-to-year (it is not panel data, in other words), but rather sampled randomly and, for purposes of aggregation, assigned weights according to how representative they are of their country’s general population. 

A portion of the questions are asked during each round (or administration) of the survey. Other questions are temporary, collected from a pool of submissions sent by cross-cultural teams of European academics. We note that as survey data, our ‘ground truth’ is generated from participant response rather than more objective measurement. 

The ESS includes data at the level of the survey respondent and is generally well-maintained; for example, almost all features are encoded numerically thanks to survey questions that lend themselves to ordinal responses, and those numbers indicating a missing or refused response are clearly specified by robust data dictionaries. We therefore suspect data cleaning to be minimal. Pre-processing, meanwhile, will likely focus on (1) identifying and filtering to columns of interest and (2) grouping and aggregating by gender, age, and geography. The former can be handled via the ESS’ online portal while the latter is simple to code.

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
